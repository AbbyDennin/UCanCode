				<p class="text-center"><font color="white"> My name is Abby Dennin and I have a passion for coding. I started learning code about one year ago and I have fallen in love with it. I realized that not everyone was lucky enough to stumble upon an ad that would bring them into the world of computer science. I created this website (with the information I have learned so far about coding) because I think that everyone should learn how to code. It is an important skill to know in this age because technology is everything. Coding can give you so many job opportunities and it gives you the power to make your idea a reality.</font> </p>

			<h2 class="text-center"><font color="4169E1"><u>U Can Code, Yes U Can!</u></font></h2>
				<p class="text-center"><font color="white"> Anyone can code. No matter how old you are, your gender, your race, no matter what you can code. There are a lot of websites like this that direct coding to girls because there are not a lot of them in the computer science world. However, I am taking a different approach. I am not specifically saying girls or boys should code (even though I am all for the Girl Power). I want everyone to be able to learn coding in an easy, fun, interactive way. That is what this website is all about. U Can make a difference, U can do anything, and U Can Code! </font></p>
